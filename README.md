## What is CodeSaver?

CodeSaver is an application designed for the purpose of helping developers of 
various computer languages save, find and recycle their code with ease. The 
platform includes a number of features that allow users to find, read, and edit code
saved in snippets. Users can create and edit their own 
snippets, search snippets by tag/topic, view and save other users' snippets, and 
view admin-recommended snippets. They can also import snippets from and export
snippets to GitHub via the GitHub Gists API.
