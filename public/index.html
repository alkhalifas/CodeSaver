                                    University in Boston Massachusetts. CodeSaver was founded on the three principles of
                                    making coding life simple, more efficient, and more productive. Our objective as a company
                                    is to build a reliable, efficient, and agile platform where people can come to save, organize,
                                    and share their code."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
